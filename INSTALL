 MAC OS X
*********

Step 0: Make sure the latero and latero-graphics libraries are installed
--------------------------------------------------
See instructions in INSTALL file for latero and latero-graphics projects.

Step 1: Install XQuartz
------------------------
If you already have XQuartz, skip to step 2. Otherwise, install it from http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/. X11 is no longer included with OS X.

Step 2: Build latero-demo
-----------------------------
>> cmake . -G Xcode
>> xcodebuild -target latero-demo
>> ./create_app_bundle.sh

You should now be able to launch the program by clicking on the latero-demo app bundle.
