Creating an App Bundle
----------------------

The process is currently done manually.

1. Right click on LateroDemo.app and select Show Package Contents.
2. Copy the executable to the MacOS folder.
3. Run "dylibbundler -od -b -x ./LateroDemo.app/Contents/MacOS/latero-studio -d ./LateroDemo.app/Contents/libs/" to fix library links. This app can be installed with MacPorts.

Todo: It seems possible to do this with CMake and XCode.
